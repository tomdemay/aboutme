          <p>
            I would like to introduce myself. My name is Tom DeMay. I am a Software Engineer currently working at Amazon AWS.
            I would like to tell you a little about me and why I feel I would be a great addition to your company.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been a Software Engineer for nearly 30 years with a tremendously wide range of experiences; as an individual contributor,
            technical lead, and management. Ultimately I am a hands-on developer. I am much more than just a coder. I am a problem solver.
            Bring whatever problem you have to me, and I will own it from inception to completion. I will build the necessary tools,
            systems, and teams and lead them to accomplish any goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a passion for the software factory process. I always look for ways to be more efficient, write maintainable code,
            improve team and organization communication, deliver consistent and reliable estimates, and mentor junior developers.
            Usually, I naturally evolve into a technical lead once I have acquired the team’s domain knowledge. I maintain a great relationship
            with all my previous employers and team mates. I refactor relentlessly. I enjoy collaborating with other engineers and managers
            I can learn from.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am aggressive about acquiring new skills and constantly learning. Fresh out of high school in 1989, before I knew what I wanted to do,
            I studied and passed the tests to obtain a series 6 and 63 license to sell securities within 2 months. In 2000, I got a private pilot’s
            license within 3 months. I am a self-taught musician having performed live for 11 years at a high level playing the piano, keyboards,
            guitar, harmonica, banjo, and even singing. I am a self-taught software engineer. By my late 20s, I had already been in engineering management,
            published by Advisor Publications, and spoke on software engineering principals at local user group meetings. When I was 30, I decided to get
            my computer science degree. I completed 4 years of school in one year and maintained a GPA of 4.0. In 2003, I built www.discountcasinogear.com
            as an experiment to learn how to build web applications. It became one of the leading sites in its industry, consistently generating half
            a million in revenue annually until I sold it for a profit in 2011. The site is still there and claims to be the largest supplier of gaming
            equipment as many of the site’s competitors have come and gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a reputation for having high standards, writing well-designed code that is maintainable, and I work well with others.
            I have bailed out a number of failing projects, received numerous awards for doing so, and I hold a patent. I mentor and develop
            the skills of junior and struggling engineers. I enjoy refactoring code. In one case, I improved performance by 3,951%.
            In that particular case, code that initially took 6 hours to run before it failed, consuming all the computer’s resources and crashing,
            was refactored to complete in 6 minutes using only 40MB of memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, I am an aggressive learner and have a passion for continued education. I have taught myself C/C++, .NET, C#,
            Windows and Linux platforms, Java, Python, PowerShell, bash, Ruby, Regular Expressions, classic ASP, HTML/CSS, SQL and No-SQL,
            various back-end databases, and cloud computing just to name a few. I am currently working on mastering front-end web development
            using Java Spring, Spring Boot, Angular, React.js, MVC and LAMP stacks and working towards my AWS and Azure certifications,
            then I plan to move on to machine learning and AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can tell, I am very proud of my history and accomplishments. I am excited to share with you my many success stories
            and even some not so successful stories that became learning opportunities for me. I honestly believe I can fit in well
            in any organization in a variety of different roles due to my passion for software engineering and for learning.
            I am open to any kind of development. Above all, I like being creative and learning, which I believe would be a tremendous
            asset to your organization. Thank you for your time and your consideration.
