                        Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Tom DeMay, and I am a Senior Software Engineer
                        currently
                        employed at Amazon AWS. I would like to share a bit about my background and explain why I

                        I would be a valuable addition to any organization.

                                With nearly 30 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I have accumulated a diverse
                                range of
                                expertise. Throughout my career, I have served in various roles, including individual
                                contributor,
                                technical lead, and management positions. While I possess a deep understanding of
                                coding, I also
                                thrive as a problem solver. No matter the challenge at hand, I take full ownership, from
                                inception
                                to completion, leveraging my ability to build the necessary tools, systems, and teams
                                required to
                                achieve the desired goals.

                                I am particularly passionate about the software development process and continuously
                                seek ways to
                                enhance efficiency, write maintainable code, improve team and organizational
                                communication, deliver
                                consistent and reliable estimates, and mentor junior developers. As I acquire domain
                                knowledge, I
                                naturally transition into a technical leadership role. My previous employers and
                                colleagues hold me
                                in high regard, appreciating my commitment to refactoring and my collaborative approach
                                when working
                                alongside other engineers and managers.

                                My insatiable appetite for learning has always driven me to acquire new skills. For
                                instance, shortly
                                after completing high school in 1989, in just under 3 months I obtained a series 6 and
                                63 license to sell
                                securities. In 2000, I earned a private pilot's license in a span of three months. In
                                addition
                                to my accomplishments outside of software engineering, I am entirely self-taught in the
                                field of software
                                engineering. By my late
                                20s, I had already assumed engineering management roles, published works on software
                                engineering
                                principles, and delivered speeches at local user group meetings. At the age of 30, I
                                pursued a computer
                                science degree, completing four years of coursework in just one year while maintaining a
                                GPA of 4.0. In
                                2003, I embarked on building <a href="https://www.discountcasinogear.com/"
                                    target="_blank">Discount Casino Gear <i
                                        class="fas fa-external-link-alt fa-xs"></i></a> as an experimental project to
                                learn how to build web sites,
                                which eventually
                                became one of the leading sites in its industry, consistently generating annual revenue
                                in the range of
                                half a million dollars until I successfully sold it for a profit in 2011. The site,
                                still operational, proudly asserts
                                its status as the largest supplier of gaming equipment, outlasting many of its
                                competitors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                My reputation is built on maintaining high standards, crafting well-designed and
                                maintainable code, and effectively
                                collaborating with others. I have rescued several failing projects, receiving numerous
                                accolades for my efforts,
                                and hold a patent. Mentoring and developing the skills of junior and struggling
                                engineers are among my passions.
                                Refactoring code is a task I relish, having achieved remarkable performance
                                improvements, such as a 3,951% boost in
                                one instance. Previously, code that originally took 6 hours to run before crashing due
                                to resource consumption was
                                refactored to complete in just 6 minutes, utilizing only 40MB of memory.

                                As evident from my journey, I possess an unwavering commitment to continuous education.
                                I have taught myself a
                                multitude of technologies, including C/C++, .NET, C#, Windows and Linux platforms, Java,
                                Python, PowerShell,
                                bash, Ruby, Regular Expressions, classic ASP, HTML/CSS, SQL and No-SQL databases, and
                                cloud computing, to name
                                a few. Currently, I am actively honing my skills in front-end web development using Java
                                Spring, Spring Boot,
                                Angular, React.js, MVC, and LAMP stacks. I am also working towards attaining my AWS and
                                Azure certifications,
                                with future plans to delve into machine learning and AI.

                                        I was actually born way back in 1968 in Camden, New Jersey, but we
                                        lived in Long Island, New York at the time. I'm the third out of four children
                                        in my
                                        family. My awesome older sister Dawn came first, followed by my older brother
                                        Robert, and then there's me. Lastly, we have my younger brother Christopher.

                                    <p>
                                        To be honest, I don't have many vivid memories of living in Long Island since I
                                        was quite young when we moved to Margate, Florida. We stayed there until just
                                        before I started 2nd grade. After that, we relocated to San Jose, California,
                                        where we spent
                                        my 2nd through 5th grade years. But the journey didn't stop there! We then
                                        packed our bags and made our way to Springfield, Virginia. We've been calling
                                        Northern Virginia our home ever since! </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After finishing high school at Hayfield High School in Alexandria, Virginia in
                                        1986, I met the love of my life, Julie DeMay, and we got married in 1991. We
                                        enjoyed living in Ashburn for about 15 years, but because it's such an expensive
                                        area, we eventually made the move to Winchester, Virginia, to save some money.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Back in 1997, our hearts overflowed with joy as we welcomed our first child,
                                        Melissa (affectionately known as Missy) DeMay, into this world. The excitement
                                        continued in 2000 when our daughter Rachel arrived, filling our lives with even
                                        more love. And just when we thought our family was complete, our first son,
                                        Trevor, joined us in 2002, bringing immense happiness. But life had another
                                        surprise in store for us! Twelve years later, in 2014, our youngest bundle of
                                        joy, Oliver DeMay, came into our lives, catching us completely off guard and
                                        filling our hearts with even more love and laughter. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Life took an unexpected turn when my sister's son, Andrew DeMay, needed a loving
                                        home at the age of 14. We gladly took custody of him and raised him as our own
                                        child. He's actually just a few days older than Missy. Now, we're eagerly
                                        awaiting the arrival of our first grandchild through Andrew and his partner
                                        Emma.

                                        When I was just 8 years old, I had a strong desire to learn guitar. So, I asked
                                        my parents to sign me up for guitar lessons. However, they ended up enrolling me
                                        in piano lessons instead. They believed it was a logical choice as I already
                                        showed an interest in the piano and had been teaching myself a bit. Although I
                                        took piano lessons until I was 16, I never quite applied myself or practiced
                                        diligently because I was more fascinated by blues and jazz, eager to learn
                                        improvisation rather than the classical music I was being taught.

                                        Back in the late 90s, fate stepped in when I met someone at Kits Jordan Music
                                        who was playing exactly the type of music I wanted to learn. Inspired, I asked
                                        him for lessons. He generously gave me two before disappearing with my money,
                                        but those two lessons proved to be invaluable. He introduced me to the
                                        pentatonic scale, and from that point on, I was off and running, eager to
                                        explore the world of music.

                                        In the late 2000s, I had an exciting opportunity to play keyboards in a local
                                        band, despite never having done so before. I thought, "Why not?" Thankfully, the
                                        band members were incredibly patient with me and took the time to show me the
                                        ropes. This experience propelled me to form my own bands and join various local
                                        groups, diving into the realms of classic rock, blues, and even venturing into
                                        The Grateful Dead and country music. I had the privilege of playing at a high
                                        level, including performances at the Washington DC Cherry Blossom festival
                                        downtown and the opening of Massanutten, Virginia's ski resort for the fall and
                                        winter seasons.

                                        Among the many memorable moments, one that stands out is the time I got to share
                                        the stage with Rick Nielsen, the mastermind behind Cheap Trick's hit song "I
                                        Want You to Want Me." We crossed paths at a hotel after their performance at the
                                        Superdome in New Orleans, and I was honored to join him on stage, playing that
                                        very song. It was an unforgettable experience, etched deeply into my musical
                                        journey.

                                        After high school, I made the decision to dive straight into the workforce. I
                                        felt too immature to continue my education in college, especially considering I
                                        had been a very poor student in high school, graduating with a 1.7 GPA. My
                                        parents had me tested and determined that I was simply bored. They believed I
                                        had the capability to do the work, but I lacked motivation. Going to college at
                                        that time would have been a waste of money, especially since I had no clear
                                        career path in mind.

                                        Personal computers were just becoming affordable for widespread use. My dad
                                        purchased an 8088 computer and I started to play with it. In 10th grade, I took
                                        an
                                        introductory programming course where we learned 'Basic' programming. The
                                        teacher, being new to the subject and a math teacher with no prior computer
                                        experience, was learning alongside us. However, the pace of learning didn't
                                        match my enthusiasm for the subject. It was one class I was truly passionate
                                        about and performed well in. The following year, I took a 'COBOL' programming
                                        course.
                                    </p>

                                        Back then, being into computers often labeled you as a "nerd," so I resisted and
                                        pushed back against my dad, who frequently told me that I would become a
                                        software engineer. I explored different paths for a while. At 19, I thought I
                                        might want to be a stockbroker, so I picked up some books and took the necessary
                                        tests to obtain my Series 6 and 63 licenses within a span of 2-3 months.
                                        However, being an immature 19-year-old, no one wanted financial advice from me,
                                        so that venture didn't work out too well.

                                        I went on to work at two different banks, a stockbroker firm as a cashier, and
                                        later as an administrative assistant at the Construction Specifications
                                        Institute. During my time there, I even had the opportunity to pose as a hand
                                        model for an advertisement featured in their magazine, which was quite
                                        enjoyable. It was at that job where I started to dabble in programming, writing
                                        'Basic' applications for myself and interacting with their mainframes.

                                        After my boss and I were laid off, she connected me with her son, who managed a
                                        team involved in computer sales to the federal government. I joined the team but
                                        quickly grew frustrated with the lack of software tools available for the sales
                                        force. Our vendors would send pricing information on a disk every month, only
                                        for it to end up in the trash. Since we were selling Fox Software's Fox Pro, I
                                        managed to obtain a free copy and began writing database applications. I
                                        developed a system to manage contacts, pricing, quotations, and order entry.
                                        That's when I discovered my true passion. I finally accepted that I had a
                                        developer's heart and embraced a role within the company creating tools for the
                                        entire organization. In my early 20s, I found myself managing a team of four,
                                        building internal systems. I was on my way.

                                        Microsoft acquired Fox Software to utilize their Rushmore technology for
                                        building Microsoft SQL Server, which eventually led to the release of Microsoft
                                        Visual FoxPro. It was my first exposure to object-oriented programming, and I
                                        was instantly captivated. I actively promoted myself within the small FoxPro
                                        community, writing articles for Advisor Publications and even gracing the cover
                                        once. I also presented at user group meetings. However, FoxPro was often
                                        considered a lesser programming language, so I desired to expand my knowledge. I
                                        began teaching myself C/C++ and left my job to pursue an opportunity to work
                                        alongside renowned figures in the FoxPro community. I hoped to gain insight into
                                        System Design and Architecture, particularly in the emerging field of
                                        client-server databases. I developed applications using Microsoft SQL Server on
                                        the backend, wrote articles for Advisor Publications, and delivered talks at
                                        local user groups to share my experiences.

                                        I had no formal training in software engineering, but my enthusiasm to learn was
                                        insatiable. I continued writing articles and wholeheartedly pursued my dream of
                                        becoming a Software Engineer. Eventually, I landed my first role as a C/C++
                                        engineer in my early 30s, working for a company that was later acquired by EMC
                                        (now part of Dell). I earned a reputation for being a dedicated worker and a
                                        skilled engineer, which led to a managerial position by my early 30s. I led a
                                        team of six people in developing a library used by 200 other EMC developers to
                                        build applications on top of it. It was a highly prominent and rewarding job,
                                        where I even received my first patent.

                                        EMC offered its employees the benefit of continued education reimbursement, and
                                        I seized that opportunity. At the age of 30, I returned to school to pursue a
                                        Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems. Eager to expedite my degree,
                                        I self-taught most of the material, took CLEP tests to test out of certain
                                        classes, and assembled portfolios to demonstrate my knowledge and receive
                                        credits for relevant life experience. I completed four years of school and
                                        graduated Summa Cum Laude with a perfect 4.0 average a year later.

                                        In 2003, web development became the next big thing, and I was eager to learn.
                                        However, there were no opportunities for me to do so in my current workplace.
                                        Therefore, I decided to venture out on my own and start experimenting. At that

                                        discovered my website and approached me for a partnership. Within six months, I

                                        Orders were sent directly to my supplier, who drop-shipped the products for me.

                                        dynamically adjust pricing to undercut them. My main focus was customer service.

                                        When I was eight years old in the mid-seventies, during the Pittsburgh Steelers'
                                        dominance in the NFL, I played my first season of football. Our team was called
                                        the Steelers, so naturally, I have been a Pittsburgh Steelers fan ever since.

                                        I enjoy coaching my kids' sports teams, and I take great pride in placing more
                                        emphasis on having fun and developing the skills of underdeveloped children than
                                        winning games. I always tell my kids that while we all want to win and play
                                        well, losing is part of the learning process. So, they shouldn't worry about
                                        whether we win or not. When we lose, it's an opportunity for all of us,
                                        including coaches, to learn from those who are better than us. Being part of an
                                        organized team offers numerous opportunities for children to learn life skills,
                                        and there are
                                        few things I find more rewarding than watching kids grow, learn, and be part of
                                        that experience.

                                        I always enjoy acquiring new skills, especially if it can save money and provide
                                        an opportunity to have fun with my children. Over the years, I have built decks,
                                        remodeled basements, handled plumbing and electrical work, set up a gym,
                                        completed various home improvement projects, and performed car maintenance. I
                                        try to pass these skills on to my children, and it brings me joy when they
                                        change their own brakes and save us all money.

                                        In 2000, I met someone who was working on their pilot's license, and I got
                                        excited about the idea. Two months later, I obtained my own pilot's license and
                                        started flying my family around the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area. I earned my
                                        license a year before the tragic events of 9/11, which resulted in me being
                                        flagged and experiencing difficulties at airport security checkpoints. During
                                        that time, our teams at EMC had to travel to the office outside of Boston
                                        regularly for a few months, and I spent numerous days and nights sleeping or
                                        working on the floor at the airport.

                                        Around 2009, as I mentioned earlier, I started playing in local bands.
                                        Primarily, I played the keyboards, but I also taught myself some guitar during
                                        my teenage years and had the opportunity to play guitar in both a country and
                                        classic rock band. Additionally, I picked up the harmonica to play Led
                                        Zeppelin's "When the Levee Breaks" and the banjo to play Zac Brown Band's
                                        "Chicken Fried" while performing in a country band.

                                        I have been an enthusiast of craft beers since before they became widely
                                        popular. I enjoy exploring new technologies, particularly in the field of cloud
                                        computing. Engaging in passionate debates with people who are smarter than me
                                        and learning from them on various topics is something I find enjoyable, and I
                                        also take pleasure in passing on that knowledge to younger generations.
